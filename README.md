[Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/sbtic-xente-credit-scoring-challenge)

### Objective:
Create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to default on their loans based on-:

  - Repayment behavior

  - ecommerce transaction activity

### Data:
[Data](https://zindi.africa/competitions/sbtic-xente-credit-scoring-challenge/data)
Files:
 -  _VariableDefinitions.csv_: Definition of the features per transaction

 - _Train.csv:_ Ecommerce transactions and associated loans from 21 September 2018 and 31 March 2019, including whether or not a customer defaulted on their loan. This is the dataset that you will use to train your model.

 - _Test.csv:_ Ecommerce transactions and associated loans from 31 March 2019 and 17 July 2019, excluding whether or not a customer defaulted on their loan. Additional variables associated with the loan have also been removed from the test set. is the dataset that you will use to test your model on.

 - _unlinked_masked_final.csv:_ e-commerce transactions not linked to any loans, but associated to customers with loan-linked e-commerce transactions.

 - _sample_submission.csv:_ is an example of what your submission file should look like, including a list of unique transaction ids and the associated loan status. The order of the rows does not matter, but the names of the TransactionId must be correct.
